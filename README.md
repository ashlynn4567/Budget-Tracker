# Budget-Tracker

This is my seventeenth challenge assignment for the University of Oregon Coding Bootcamp 2022. In this project, I take an existing budget-tracker application and update it to allow for offline access and functionality. I add these features using tools such as IndexedDB, Service Workers, and Web Manifests.

With this new verison of the application, users can now add expenses and deposits to their budget with or without an internet connection. If the user enters transactions offline, the total will update once they are brought back online.
